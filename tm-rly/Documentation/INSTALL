# In theory we use autotools to build the timemachine. Unfortunaly 
# the autotools aren't completely configured, so maybe you need to
# handtune the build process. 
#
#
# The timemachine needs:
# - libpcap
# - libpcapnav
# - libpcre, esp. pcrecpp
# - libpthreads
# - libreadline
#
#optional:
# - broccoli


# Configuration/Build options:
# If some of the libs above are installed in non-standard directories,
# you must specify them using LDFLAGS and CXXFLAGS
# LDFLAGS='-L/path/to/libraries/lib'
# CXXFLAGS='-I/path/to/libraries/include'

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

# Configure and compile:
#	./configure
#	make
# Intresting options for configure: 
#     --disable-broccoli  .... buidl without broccoli support
#     --enable-debug
#
# I suggest you run the timemachine directly from the build directory
#
# see Documentation/TUNING on how to get good performance from the
# timemachine
#
# ATTENTION FreeBSD Users: You really want to read the MEMORY
# ALLOCATOR SECTION of the the TUNING file.
