************************** Timemachine Note  *******************************
Slightly modified for use with tm.  Blame tm developers for bugs.
This README is from the original ptmalloc2 distribution.  Some files have
been deleted (most notable: Makefile). See the http://www.malloc.de/en
for the original distribution.

Note: That ptmalloc is also part of glibc, so ptmalloc has two 
licences: BSD-like and LGPL.
See http://www.malloc.de/en/ for details.
